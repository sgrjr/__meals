	"preparation": [
		"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a cookie sheet with nonstick cooking spray (just for convenience :]).",
		"Using a mixer with the paddle attachment, mix together the butter, brown sugar, honey, egg and water thoroughly.",
		"Sift together the dry ingredients then stir in the oats. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix. Add any additional ingredients you've chosen.",
		"Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls onto the cookie sheet. Bake 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack."
	],
	"note": "These are easy to make! and healthy for you too (small amount of butter & sugar), but still so very sweet and wholesome. The cookies are chewy and go great with any other add-ins (raisins, cranberries, chocolate chips, etc.)"
