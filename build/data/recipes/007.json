	"note": "(Vietnamese) Not all hot dogs are created equal. Reaching for the right brand in the grocery store can have a huge impact on your intake of fat and sodium. For a healthier hot dog, choose one thatâ€™s no more than 150 calories, has 3 grams or less of saturated fat and 370 mg or less of sodium. <br> Nature's Place Chicken Sausage is a great alternative: cal: 70, fat: 2, satfat: 0, carbs: 1, protein: 11 (Substitute this sometime in nutrition info and ingredients) -- add peas to nutrition and ingredients"
