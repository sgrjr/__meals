	"preparation":[
		"MEATBALLS: 1/3 cup bulgur | 1/2 cup hot water | 8 ounces ground turkey | 1 medium onion, very finely chopped | 2 large egg whites, lightly beaten | 3 cloves garlic, very finely chopped | 1 teaspoon dried oregano | 1/2 teaspoon salt | 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper | 1 cup fresh breadcrumbs (3 slices of bread), preferably whole-wheat (see Note)",
		"SAUCE & SPAGHETTI: 4 cups prepared marinara sauce | 1/2 cup slivered fresh basil leaves, or chopped fresh parsley | 1 pound whole-wheat spaghetti, or linguine | 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan (1 ounce) | To prepare meatballs: Combine bulgur and water in a small bowl. Let stand until the bulgur is tender and the liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes.",
		"Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Coat a rack with cooking spray and place it over a baking sheet lined with foil.",
		"Combine ground beef, sausage, onion, egg whites, garlic, oregano, salt, pepper, breadcrumbs and the soaked bulgur in a large bowl; mix well. Form the mixture into 1-inch meatballs (about 24). Place the meatballs on the rack and bake for 25 minutes. Blot well with paper towel.",
		"To prepare sauce & spaghetti: Put a large pot of lightly salted water on to boil. Bring sauce to a simmer in a Dutch oven. Add the meatballs to the sauce and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes. Stir in basil (or parsley).",
		"Meanwhile, cook spaghetti (or linguine) until just tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a serving bowl. Top with the sauce and meatballs and serve with grated cheese."
