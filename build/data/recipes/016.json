	"note": "This was excellent with some adjustments (I think as is I would rate it 3 or 4 stars). Here are the adjustments: First off, I added three chopped up celery sticks. Also, taking the advice of the other reviewer, I doubled up on the sauce by adding an extra cup of chicken broth towards the end and just a little more cornstarch for the extra broth (appx 1 tsp extra), and a couple dashes (appx 1 tbsp) of rice wine vinegar as the veggies were steaming. After taking out the kids' portions, I added extra Asian Garlic Chili sauce for a little more heat/flavor, and served over brown rice. I think it would have been too dry without the extra sauce. It was excellent with these changes. || Calories 321.4<br>Total Fat 14.8 g<br>Saturated Fat 2.4 g<br>Polyunsaturated Fat 1.5 g<br>Monounsaturated Fat 3.9 g<br>Cholesterol 70.2 mg<br>Sodium 543.9 mg<br>Potassium 727.1 mg<br>Total Carbohydrate 16.9 g<br>Dietary Fiber 6.0 g<br>Sugars 5.2 g<br>Protein 30.2 g<br>Vitamin A 210.2 %<br>Vitamin B-12 7.2 %<br>Vitamin B-6 40.0 %<br>Vitamin C 180.2 %<br>Vitamin D 0.0 %<br>Vitamin E 4.1 %<br>Calcium 10.6 %<br>Copper 7.7 %<br>Folate 18.7 %<br>Iron 13.1 %<br>Magnesium 12.8 %<br>Manganese 19.0 %<br>Niacin 65.8 %<br>Pantothenic Acid 10.9 %<br>Phosphorus 27.1 %<br>Riboflavin 8.3 %<br>Selenium 30.7 %<br>Thiamin 10.1 %<br>Zinc 8.7 %"
