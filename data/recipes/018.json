	"ingredients": [
		"1 (10-ounce) Italian cheese-flavored thin pizza crust (such as Boboli)",
		"3/4 cup tomato chutney",
		"2 cups chopped roasted skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 2 breasts)",
		"2/3 cup diced plum tomato",
		"3/4 cup (3 ounces) shredded extra-sharp white cheddar cheese",
		"1/3 cup chopped green onions"
	],
	"preparation": [
		"Preheat oven to 450 degrees.",
		"Place crust on a baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees for 3 minutes. Remove from oven; spread chutney over crust, leaving a 1/2-inch border.",
		"Top chutney with chicken. Sprinkle diced tomato, cheese, and green onions evenly over chicken. Bake at 450 degrees for 9 minutes or until cheese melts. Cut pizza into 6 wedges."
	],
	"note": "Note: If you can't find tomato chutney, make your own. Combine 2 cups diced plum tomato, 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 3 tablespoons cider vinegar, 1/8 teaspoon Jamaica√± jerk seasoning, and 1 minced garlic clove in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium; cook 20 minutes or untril thickened. SOO great! Tomato chutney sauce is AMAZING! an absolute must!I did not have any jerk seasoning so I substituted a few splashes of Franks Hot Sauce. I found that I didn't have enough sauce so I doubled the recipe for the sauce and it was perfect!"
